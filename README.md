## **Pop Culture Buzz Predictor**

Forecasting tomorrow’s trends, today.

---

## **Project Overview**

*Problem statement:*

Marketers, creators, and brands often react late to cultural trends because existing platforms only show what is already popular. There is a lack of tools that can forecast upcoming spikes in popularity, making it difficult to anticipate audience engagement in advance.

*Solution Statement:*

Developed a **Pop Culture Buzz Predictor** that integrates Google Trends data to forecast trend spikes three weeks in advance. The interactive Streamlit dashboard lets users enter any keyword (artist, show, or song) and instantly see historical popularity and spikes along with predicted future buzz, enabling timely decisions for marketers and creators. Popularity trends and dynamic insights are also included.

*Scope:*
1. Detect buzz spikes in artists, shows, and songs.
2. Visualize long-term vs. short-term popularity.
3. Forecast upcoming engagement with Prophet.
4. Deliver insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

This makes trend anticipation actionable, helping brands and marketers plan campaigns, product launches, and cross-promotions strategically.
